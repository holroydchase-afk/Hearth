# Handoff: end of day 2 (Thu Oct 15, 2026, 10:30 pm)

## Verified state (rerun independently at 1:30 pm)
- **Backend:** 110 RLS + 130 API SQL tests green. Deno sign-media tests 5/5. Integration smoke test 4/4 over real PostgREST. `get_feed` p95 is under 2 ms at 1M posts.
- **App:** typecheck clean; Jest 179 passed + 1 skipped (live-API block); web e2e 3/3. Contract tests against real PostgREST: 19/19 of the runnable ones.
- **Prototype + Test Log:** 32/32 prototype cases green. The Test Log page is published; its data covers runs through day 2 morning only.

## Not done
1. **GitHub.** The repo exists at github.com/holroydchase-afk/Hearth but is **empty**. Claude can't reach it until Chase links GitHub at claude.ai/code and installs the Claude GitHub App on the repo. Meanwhile the code goes over as a bundle.
2. **CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)** has never run. Its first run closes S16: the backend tests on a real Supabase stack.
3. **Notifications aren't built**, push or email. This is the biggest gap. NOTIFY-1/2/3 and REPLY-3 depend on it.
4. **Nothing has run on a real phone yet.** Unverified: resize, save to phone, OTP email, deep links, push.
5. **Missing API endpoints:** push-token save, notification prefs, profile name, who hearted, re-signing an upload after a crash (see `app/README.md`, "API.md gaps").
6. **The Test Log isn't updated.**
   - S9 and S10 still show open there.
   - New app suites and runs aren't recorded.
   - Run `tracker/build_seed.py` and push it to the Test Log artifact (claude.ai/artifact/XnfnBsuPL7ayedPHBpvctD).
7. **Video is off for the beta.** iOS location metadata can't be stripped without a transcoder.

## Chase's to-dos (blocking)
- Link GitHub: claude.ai/code → connect GitHub, then install the Claude GitHub App on Hearth (github.com/apps/claude/installations/new).
- Confirm Apple Developer enrollment.
- Create the accounts:
  - Supabase: a staging and a prod project, both East US
  - Backblaze B2: US East, which can't be changed later
  - Expo, Resend, and the Google Play Console
- Run the name check, then buy the domain.
- Phone survey by Oct 20: each person's phone model, OS version, and the email they actually check.
- Decisions (picks in `CORE-FEATURES.md`): an Android test phone (~$100), upgrading the Claude plan, and the 5 product questions.

## Next session, in order
1. Confirm the repo is pushed and CI is running. Fix CI until it's green; that closes S16.
2. **staff-pm:** daily triage. Update the Test Log.
3. **app-engineer + qa-tdd, test-first:** the notification sender (Expo push + Resend email, batched, with no image or caption in the payload) plus the missing RPCs.
4. **Infra:** staging Supabase deploy, Resend sending domain, an invite-link/privacy-policy page.
5. First Android internal build (EAS), then iPhone TestFlight once Apple approves.
